\section{Introduction} \label{sec-introduction}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Main question: Language isn’t a monolith -- people can choose many different ways to describe the exact  same thing. What explains that variation in language? Specifically, we focus on grounded language that is about things in the world -- \textbf{what explains the set of concepts people choose to convey that thing, and in particular, what determines the level of abstraction that they choose?}
    \item Prior work (eg. Tian) has demonstrated that people perceive and quickly learn abstract domain structure - in particular, that they are attentive to the set of abstract concepts used to carve up the space, and that the way they parse images drawn from a generative model is consistent with the optimal concept library fit to the stimuli they observe.
    \item We hypothesize that this is reflected in language -- that people produce language that reflects an abstract, domain-specific concept library. 
    \item We adopt the more formal modeling hypothesis in (LOT, Tian, McCarthy, Wong, others): that people represent underlying domain-structure in a compositional, language-like LOT, and specifically, a domain-specific concept library with program-like structure. Therefore, our hypothesis can be evaluated by looking for correlations in the language produced and underlying programs, drawn from differing formal DSLs at different levels of abstraction.
    \item To evaluate this:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item We collect a corpus of grounded language in which this can be studied systematically in two domains (Section \ref{sec-dataset}), comprised of two domains with hierarchical structure in how the stimuli vary, and permitting multiple levels of abstraction - in which we have access to differing ground truth DSLs that generate the stimuli.
            \item We first compare a base DSL of low-level parts to two increasingly higher order DSLs and find that the language people produce is better explained by a higher-order, part-based concept library (Section B.)

% todo: tie to program abstraction
% Desiderata: 1) varied set of categories, 2) hierarchical structure; 3) primitives + higher-order abstractions available to describe, 4) novel + evocative

% 	What do these buy us?
% #1 more general findings
% #2 reminiscent of hierarchical structure of real-world concepts
% #3 allows us to test the notion of "basic-level" but for parts (Rosch et al.) (“just right” level of abstraction)
% #4 lets us look at learning (later)

To investigate how the compositional structure of an object's domain affects the language people use to describe that object, we designed a collection of artificial image stimuli that were hierarchically constructed from smaller parts. 
% Different primitives (i.e. difference between domains)
Our stimulus set consisted of two distinct domains that were each procedurally generated from a set of base primitives.
\textit{Gadgets} were designed to resemble technical drawings of functional objects, and were composed of digital pen strokes. 
\textit{Structures} were designed to resemble architectural structures, and were composed of horizontal and vertical blocks.
Each item corresponded to a generative program involving the base primitives of its domain. 
Critically, each domain involved a set of mid-level abstractions  (e.g. \textit{wheels}, \textit{roofs}) that could appear across different stimuli. 

% Different compositional structure within domain (difference between subdomains)
Furthermore, each domain was further subdivided into four subdomains, which were each defined by a distinct generative procedure that was hand-designed to produce objects of a recognizable subordinate category (e.g. \textit{furniture}, \textit{castle}) from a set of predefined abstractions (e.g. \textit{legs}, \textit{tower}).
Several of these abstractions were shared between subdomains (\textit{roofs}, for example appeared in both \textit{houses} and \textit{skyscrapers}), which allowed us to compare the language used to pick out abstraction types in different contexts.
We enumerated all possible stimuli for each subdomain, and selected a random but biased sample of each to obtain 250 stimuli of varying size for each subdomain.


\subsection{Language production task}

% goal
To collect a corpus of language in which ...
% procedural
To evoke a thorough decomposition of each object's component parts, we asked participants to produce a complete sequence of instructions for constructing each stimulus.
Each participant produced instructions for 10 items from a single \textit{subdomain} (e.g. only \textit{castles}), either describing how to ``draw'' the item if describing a subdomain of \textit{gadgets}, or how to ``build'' the item if it was a \textit{structure}.
% what/where framing
To disentangle referring expressions from spatial information, we provided an interface in which participants could enter step-by-step instructions, where each step involved typing \textit{what} would be placed/drawn \textit{where} in separate ``what'' and ``where'' text boxes.
Participants could add as many instruction steps as they liked, and had no time limit.

% familiarization and design
To familiarize participants with the kinds of stimuli and abstraction that could appear in their subdomain, they were first required to click through images of 25 other stimuli from their subdomain, disjoint with the set to be described. 
While describing each image, they could also see up to 7 of the upcoming stimuli.
We collected data from participants until all (2 domains * 4 subdomains * 250) stimuli had been described by at least 2 participants with complete datasets (i.e. had described all 10 of their items).
\todo{how many participants did we collect in the end? how many descriptions?}
Participants were paid around \$15 per hour for their time.
